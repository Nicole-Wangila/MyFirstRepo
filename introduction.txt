Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Nicole Wangila, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Nursing and Public Health. I am deeply interested in understanding how chronic diseases affect populations, particularly in underserved communities, and I aim to contribute to evidence-based strategies that improve public health outcomes. 
By combining data analysis, community engagement, and public health frameworks, I hope to support resilient health systems and promote equitable care. My goal is to work with professionals across disciplines to design interventions that are impactful and sustainable.
